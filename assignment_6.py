# Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.

# Sol.--> Your car is a great example of abstraction. You can start a car by turning the key or pressing
# the start button. You don't need to know how the engine is getting started, what all components your car has.
# The car internal implementation and complex logic is completely hidden from the user.


# Q2-->Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.
# Sol.Abstraction is a way of representing some specific data. Encapsulation is a way of hiding the complexity
# of something and exposing only the parts you wish to expose. For example, if you have a class that has one
# or more private fields that you use to store the data, then you are in encapsulation.

# Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?
# Sol--> 'abc' module provides the infrastructure for defining custom abstract base classes.
# It is used for abstraction

# Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?
# Data Abstraction in Python can be achieved through creating abstract classes and inheriting them later

# Can we create an instance of an abstract class? Explain your answer.
# Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed. When an abstract class is subclassed,
#  the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class. However,
#   if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract .
