# Q1 Explain Class and Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.

# Sol.A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value. A class also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class

# create class
# class Bike:
#     name = ""
#     gear = 0

# # create objects of class
# bike1 = Bike()

# Q2--> Name the four pillars of OOPs
# The Four Pillars of Object Oriented Programming
# Abstraction.
# Encapsulation.
# Inheritance.
# Polymorphism.

# Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.

# Sol.__init__ is a special python method that runs whenever a new object is created.
# These types of functions are used to initialize the attributes of that class, E.g.,
#  if the class is Person, then the attributes will be name, age, etc

# Why self is used in OOPs?
# Sol.self variable is used to represent the instance of the class which is often used in object-oriented programming. 




# Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.
# Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class

# Types of inheritance:-
# Single Inheritance.
# Multiple Inheritance.
# Multilevel Inheritance.
# Hierarchical Inheritance.
# Hybrid Inheritance
